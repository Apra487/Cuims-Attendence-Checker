## Scheduling ðŸš€

To schedule the task we can use different techniques depending upon Operating System.<br>

* **macOS** <br>
 I am using ```Launchd```, a tool for running daemons and agents on macOS for scheduling my task.
 
* **linux**<br>
We can use ```Cron``` to schedule our task.

* **windows**<br>
We can use **Task Scheduler** to schedule our task.
